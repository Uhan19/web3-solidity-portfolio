# Design Exercise

Good answers, except this has got me scared:

"Most security"

N-of-N has very little security, it's like the 1-of-N model. Yes, it requires lots of signatures to make a change and thus high consensus amongst the owners, but the moment any one of the owners decides it's in their self interest to hold the wallet hostage, the wallet is unusable. Every user is a single point of failure for that reason, in addition to the reason you mentioned of losing your key.
